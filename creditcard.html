                        <p>Secured credit cards have a bad reputation, and most of these products deserve it. Too often, the companies that offer secured cards do so to prey on those with poor or little credit history by charging exorbitant interest rates and outrageous fees. But using the right product from a reputable institution, holders of secured cards can repair or build their credit while enjoying many of the benefits of standard credit cards that they might not qualify for.

                        <h2 class="mb-3">How a Secured Card Works</h2>
                        <p>Standard credit cards are not secured by any property or deposits that can be repossessed in case of default. Therefore, applicants for these unsecured loans must first be able to show banks a strong credit history. On the other hand, almost any applicant will qualify for a secured credit card. With a secured card, the cardholder must first pay a security deposit that protects the bank against the risk of default. In all other ways, a secured card operates just like a standard credit card. Cardholders receive monthly bills that they must pay on time or incur interest and penalties. At the same time, banks will report payment information to the credit bureaus, allowing cardholders to build their credit history.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Your first priority in shopping for a secured card will be to stick with a reputable bank and avoid the numerous products with high interest rates and unreasonable fees. Shoppers should look for a card with a low annual fee and perhaps one that might earn interest on their deposit. Finally, applicants should be aware that not all banks guarantee acceptance, so those with outstanding liens or a recent bankruptcy will not qualify for some of these cards..</p>

                                        <h5>When You Should Get a Secured Card</h5>
                                        <p>Those who have poor credit or no credit history may be tempted to just wash their hands of the entire credit card business. Unfortunately, that would be a mistake. Obtaining a secured card and making on-time payments is a critical way to repair or build one's credit. Whether it is right or wrong, companies today use credit scores for any loan application, background checks when hiring, and for setting rates for services such as car insurance. Furthermore, travelers will find it difficult or impossible to reserve a hotel room or rent a car without holding a credit card</p>

                        <p>Those who live under a mountain of credit card debt quickly realize that their suffering has two components. First there is the principal, the actual amount of goods and services that was charged to their credit card. Secondly, there are the financing charges imposed each month on their balance. With each statement cycle, their average daily balance is multiplied by one twelfth of the card's Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Therefore, if you owe $6500 on a card with an APR of 18%, you are incurring almost $100 in interest each month.

                            Due to the effect of compounding interest, the finance charges incurred each month add to your balance, resulting in more interest being accrued with each passing month. (See also: What You Must Know Before Transferring Credit Card Balances)

                            How a Balance Transfer Works
                            To help relieve the burden of debt and acquire new customers, banks have long offered credit cards with a 0% promotional APR, for a limited time, on balance transfers. Applicants who qualify for a new card with these promotional rates can have their existing balance paid off by their new card. During the time that the 0% promotional rate applies, interest is not being accrued on the balance transferred; however, the amount transferred is almost always subject to a one-time balance transfer fee.
                        </br>
                            This fee, typically 3%-5%, is added to the new balance. Also, cardholders are still responsible for making minimum payments on their account. New transactions may incur interest at the standard rate, although in some instances, the 0% promotional rate also applies to new purchases as well. Finally, no matter how much you are struggling with your debt, it is critical that you continue to make all of your payments on time, as only applicants with the excellent credit will qualify for most of these promotional credit card offers.

                            How to Save Money With a Balance Transfer
                            First, it is crucial that those seeking a balance transfer do so as part of a comprehensive plan to eliminate their credit card debt. Such a plan should focus on maximizing their income, minimizing their expenses, and regularly paying down their entire credit card balance before the promotional rate expires.
                        </br>
                            As part of an overall plan to eliminate debt, the benefits of a balance transfer are clear. For example, if a cardholder has an existing credit balance of $10,000 on a card with a 18% APR, that cardholder is currently accruing almost $150 in interest each month. If the cardholder continues to pay interest while reducing the balance by $700 each month, that person will still have accrued $1,340 of interest over the 17 months it took him to pay off the balance.
                        </br>
                            Alternatively, that person could accept a balance transfer offer of 15 months at 0% interest with a 3% balance transfer fee. In this case, that person's old balance of $10,000 will be paid off, while they will incur a new balance of $10,000 plus $300 in balance transfer fees. If all goes according to plan, at the end of the 15 months, the new balance will be paid off and the cardholder will have saved over $1,000 in interest.
                        </br>
                            A 0% balance transfer is not an instant solution to the problem of credit card debt. You should think of these offers as a significant push up a big mountain, but you will still have to do most of the work yourself. 
                            
                            Top 0% Balance Transfer Cards on the Market
